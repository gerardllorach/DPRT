# Dual task paradigm
This is a demo of a dual task paradigm for listening and speaking effort using a Digital Pursuit Rotor Tracking (DPRT). You can try the demo here: https://gerardllorach.github.io/DPRT/

This paradigm was used in the work from Thomas et al.:
* Trisha Thomas, Gerard Llorach, Clara Martin and Sendy Caffarra. Does accented speech affect attention and information retention? The 4th International Symposium on Applied Phonetics (ISAPh 2022). Oral presentation.
* Listening effort across accents: Does it affect memory? The 22nd meeting of the European Society for Cognitive Psychology (ESCoP 2022). Poster session.
